# PANfm v1.5.1 - "Hotfix Selector"

**Release Date:** October 29, 2025
**Release Type:** Patch (Bug Fix)

---

## üêõ Critical Bug Fixes

### 1. Upgrade Confirmation Modal Version Display

**Problem:** When selecting a hotfix version (e.g., `12.1.3-h1`) from the PAN-OS upgrade dropdown, the confirmation modal was incorrectly showing the base version (`12.1.3`) instead of the selected hotfix version.

**Impact:** This could cause user confusion and potentially lead to installing the wrong version if the user didn't notice the discrepancy.

**Root Cause:** The `upgradeState.selectedVersion` was initialized when "Check for Updates" was clicked, but there was a potential race condition where the dropdown change event listener might not reliably update the state before the upgrade workflow started.

**Solution:** Added explicit re-read of the dropdown value at the start of `startUpgradeWorkflow()` function to ensure the confirmation always uses the user's actual selected version from the UI.

**Files Changed:**
- `static/pages-panos-upgrade.js` - Added 7 lines to re-read dropdown value
- Added debug logging for version selection tracking

**Example:**
```
Before Fix: "This will upgrade PAN-OS from 12.1.2 to 12.1.3"
After Fix:  "This will upgrade PAN-OS from 12.1.2 to 12.1.3-h1"
```

### 2. Sidebar PAN-OS Version Display

**Problem:** The sidebar was displaying "N/A" for the PAN-OS version instead of showing the actual version (e.g., `12.1.3-h1`).

**Impact:** Users couldn't see the current PAN-OS version at a glance in the sidebar, making it harder to quickly verify firewall version status.

**Root Cause:** The `get_software_updates()` function in `firewall_api_devices.py` was not extracting the PAN-OS version from the `<sw-version>` XML element. It only extracted the "Application & Threat" version, so when the dashboard looked for a software entry named "PAN-OS", it couldn't find one.

**Solution:** Added extraction of the `<sw-version>` element and added it to the software list with the name "PAN-OS" so the dashboard can properly display it.

**Files Changed:**
- `firewall_api_devices.py` - Added 4 lines to extract PAN-OS version

**Example:**
```
Before Fix: PAN-OS Version: N/A
After Fix:  PAN-OS Version: 12.1.3-h1
```

## ‚ö° Rate Limiting Improvements

Updated rate limits to support auto-refresh workflows:

**Monitoring Endpoints:** 600/hour
- `/api/throughput`, `/api/health`, `/api/system-logs`, `/api/traffic-logs`
- `/api/interfaces`, `/api/license`, `/api/applications`, `/api/settings`
- Supports 5-second auto-refresh (12/min = 720/hr, set to 600 for safety)

**Operational Endpoints:** 100/hour
- Device create/update/delete, PAN-OS upgrades, Content updates
- Allows testing, retries, and normal workflows

**Impact:** Fixes rate limit errors during auto-refresh operations
